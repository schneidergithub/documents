## Definition
JTBD is a lens that reveals the circumstances (forces) that push/pull people and organizations toward/away from choices, including functional, social, and emotional dimensions.  
Reference: Christensen Institute. https://www.christenseninstitute.org/theory/jobs-to-be-done/

## Use with course problem statements
- Keep the course’s problem statement as a baseline.
- Add:
  - hiring context (situation)
  - desired progress/outcome
  - forces: push/pull, anxieties, habits
- This helps segmentation and positioning by focusing on “why” rather than demographics.
