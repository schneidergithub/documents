## Definition (practical)
An Opportunity Solution Tree is a visual that connects:
Outcome → Opportunities → Solutions → Experiments.

Reference: Teresa Torres (ProductTalk). https://www.producttalk.org/opportunity-solution-trees/

## Why it fits with the course
- The course’s opportunity analysis already identifies objectives, problems, segments, and sizing.
- OST adds explicit traceability from an outcome to the opportunities/solutions/experiments used to reach it.
