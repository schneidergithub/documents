## Concept
Run discovery and delivery in parallel:
- **Discovery track**: generate validated backlog items (reduce risk before building).
- **Delivery track**: produce releasable software.

SVPG also describes “continuous product discovery” as an ongoing process rather than a one-time phase.

## Mapping to course
- Discovery track ↔ course work on problem statements, research, segmentation, opportunity analysis.
- Delivery track ↔ downstream execution (beyond Sessions 1–3).
