## Why this exists
The course frameworks remain useful, but many teams now run “continuous discovery + continuous delivery” operating models. This folder maps course artifacts to practices commonly referenced in modern product orgs.

## Mapping: course artifact → modern practice

### Problem statements → JTBD + Value Proposition Canvas (optional overlays)
- Course problem statements stay valid as an intake artifact.
- Overlay JTBD to capture functional/social/emotional forces and “hire” context.
- Overlay Value Proposition Canvas to connect customer jobs/pains/gains to product pain relievers/gain creators.

### Opportunity analysis → discovery system with explicit outcomes
- Keep the course’s opportunity analysis checklist as the “decision package”.
- Add an explicit outcome metric (North Star or outcome metric) to keep discovery aligned to results.
- Use Opportunity Solution Trees (OST) to keep outcome → opportunity → solution → experiment traceability.

### Research & segmentation → continuous discovery cadence
- The course’s research taxonomy stays valid.
- Many orgs push toward ongoing discovery (weekly customer touchpoints) run by the same cross-functional team that builds the product.

### Sizing & business case → TAM/SAM/SOM + sensitivity
- The course’s estimation method remains correct.
- TAM/SAM/SOM is a common communication frame when presenting sizing to execs/investors; pair it with assumptions and sensitivity notes.

### Prioritization (not explicit in Sessions 1–3) → RICE (optional)
- When choosing which opportunities/solutions to pursue, RICE is a commonly used scoring model (reach, impact, confidence, effort).

## Guardrails
- Treat these as optional overlays; do not replace course artifacts unless your org’s product model requires it.
