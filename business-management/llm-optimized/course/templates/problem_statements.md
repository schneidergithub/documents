## Template 1 (narrative)
`The <user/customer> who <context of the activity> needs a <solution> because unexpectedly <insight>.` (S3 p15)

> Note: the slide shows `<solution>` in the template. In practice, the course also emphasizes writing the statement from the customer’s point of view and separating problem from solution where appropriate. (S3 p19)

## Template 2 (“I am a… / my problem is… / life would be better…”)
- I am a: `<role in business or life>`
- And this is my problem: `<describe ONLY the problem>`
- If I could solve this problem, my life would be better: `<benefits>`  
Source: Session 3 (Problem Definition Template). (S3 p19)

## Rules / constraints
- Describe **only** the problem, not the solution. (S3 p19)
- Write from the customer’s point of view. (S3 p19)
- You may need multiple statements: buyer, user, influencer. (S3 p19)

## Signals you need a problem statement
- Scope creep
- Off schedule
- Inconsistent expectations  
Source: Session 3 (Problem Definition Template). (S3 p19)

## “Solution-word” linting idea (optional)
Flag drafts that include technology or implementation nouns early (e.g., “database”, “app”, “automation”) unless intentionally writing a combined problem+solution hypothesis.
