## Model
Customer adoption groups over time:
- Innovators (technology enthusiasts)
- Early adopters (visionaries)
- **Chasm**
- Early majority (pragmatists)
- Late majority (conservatives)
- Laggards (skeptics)  
Source: Geoffrey Moore model as shown in Session 1/2. (S1 p29; S2 p16)

## Interpretation notes (as taught)
- Early groups emphasize technology/performance.
- Later groups emphasize solutions/convenience and lower risk.
- The “chasm” is the risk point moving from early adopters to early majority. (S2 p16)

## Usage
- Place your product and key competitors on the curve to understand whether your strategy must be:
  - breakthrough/edge-seeking vs
  - risk-reducing, convenience, and solution packaging.
