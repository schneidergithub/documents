## Stages
Introduction → Growth → Maturity → Decline. (S2 p30)

## Stage strategy matrix (summary of the slide)
The course provides stage-appropriate guidance across:
- Customer goal (competitive edge → share/profit → safety/price → retirement)
- Marketing objective (awareness/trial → share → profit → replace)
- Product strategy (basic → extensions → full line/best sellers)
- Price / distribution / promotion adjustments  
Source: “PLC Stages & Strategies” (Kotler) as shown. (S2 p31)

## Variation: cycle-recycle
An “upgrade pattern” where sales re-spike through recycled cycles. (S2 p32)
