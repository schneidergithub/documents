## Purpose
Practice breaking down sizing questions so you can do rough estimates quickly (e.g., revenue model brainstorming, exec questions). (S1 p32–33)

## Method (repeatable)
1. Define the scope of the problem. (S1 p33)
2. Document essential facts. (S1 p33)
3. If information is missing, make reasonable assumptions. (S1 p33)
4. Structure the problem so it adapts when facts change. (S1 p33)
5. Do not lose track of the original question. (S1 p33)

## Output format (LLM-friendly)
- `question`
- `scope`
- `facts[]`
- `assumptions[]`
- `model_equations`
- `computed_estimate`
- `sensitivity_notes`
